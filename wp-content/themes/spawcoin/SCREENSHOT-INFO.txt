THEME SCREENSHOT - How to Add

The theme is fully functional without a screenshot, but adding one makes it look professional
in WordPress Admin > Appearance > Themes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Filename: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200x900 pixels (4:3 ratio)
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- Location: Place in this folder (wp-content/themes/spawcoin/)

QUICK WAYS TO CREATE:

Option 1: Take a Screenshot
1. Activate the theme on your WordPress site
2. Visit your homepage
3. Take a screenshot (use browser extensions or built-in tools)
4. Resize to 1200x900
5. Save as screenshot.png

Option 2: Use Design Tools
- Canva: canva.com (free templates available)
- Figma: figma.com (free for individuals)
- Photoshop, GIMP, or any image editor

Option 3: Use Placeholder
WordPress will show a default gray placeholder if screenshot.png is missing.
Your theme will work perfectly either way!

RECOMMENDED CONTENT:
- Show your homepage design
- Include "Spawcoin" theme name
- Use theme colors: #6366f1, #ec4899, #14b8a6
- Make it look professional

NOTE: The theme will work perfectly without a screenshot.
This is purely cosmetic for the WordPress admin interface.
